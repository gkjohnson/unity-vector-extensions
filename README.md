# unity-vector-extensions
Vector extensions to add hlsl-like functionality, like derivative vector getter functions.

## TODO
- [ ] Add operator overloading for per-component addition and multiplication of vectors
- [ ] Add some HLSL functions?
- [ ] Add extensions for colors? (`c.rr`, `c.grb`, etc)
